TODOs:

Solid MNIST Dataset:

- [x] Port data augmentation to C++ using ASM
- [ ] Complete SolidMNIST dataset generation including filleting, degree elevation/knot refinement, spatial deformation augmentations
- [ ] Completely remove Fusion as a dependency by using ASM Tk to generate profile curves from fonts

Convolution:
- [ ] Weighted convolution using first fundamental form
- [ ] Coordinate convolution using determinant of first fundamental form as an additional channel in the input
- [ ] Trimming mask multiplied with feature maps
- [ ] Coordinate convolution using trimming mask as an additional channel in the input
- [ ] Trimming curves as edge features
- [ ] Ablation study
